## **Early Education**

### **Academic achievements obtained at school**

#### **High School**

My first challenge came from my high school entrance exam. Under the "Hukou" system in China, getting an offer from Shanghai High School was difficult since my birthplace was not in Shanghai. The "Hukou" system is China's household registration system, tying access to local services like education to one's birthplace. Non-local people can't access the foundation server, such as education and retirement security.

After a struggling seeking process, I was admitted to a private high school. Since my high school's purpose is to provide education for the non-local student, they find it hard to get enough resources to support their education process. But it didn't bother me too much. I established a good relationship with my high school teachers, learned considerable knowledge from them, and achieved satisfactory results in the college entrance examination.

I was one of the top five in my High School. My mathematics and Mandarin courses were the top ones in my class. As one of the few students who got an offer from the university in my High School, my University Entrance examination result was 484 points. For details, Since 1985, Shanghai has used a different scoring system and test papers in the university entrance examination than other provinces. The Maximum score is 630 points, and in 2011, the university entrance examination admission score was 393 points. About 19.70% of students got a higher score than 462 points in 2011 in Shanghai.

My high school experience taught me if there is a wall between me and the target, I should try to climb it. If I fail, try again.

#### **University**

Based on my interest in automation at that time, I chose the mechanical design, manufacturing, and automation as my major. I applied to three universities; their locations are pretty far away from Shanghai, located in the north and northwest, since I wanted to learn not only academic knowledge but also a different culture.

My university is in the top 100 of 2820 universities in China. In addition to its ranking and location, I also like that it is a comprehensive university, which means that I can not only learn scientific knowledge but also be exposed to various literature and philosophy. For example, the debate competition in which I actively participated.

My results and performance during university can be reflected in my Graduation Project. In my second year, my tutor was unable to find suitable candidates from among his graduate students to participate in his project on metal 3D printers. I recommended myself, and with my extracurricular competition experience in high school, I became a member of his team, responsible for microcontroller control and sensor debugging. I used the control algorithm part of it as my graduation project. I got 91 points out of 100, and my GPA was 8.73 in the final term; the maximum is 10 points.

My interest in embedded systems also started from that project. My skill in C language was practised well, and I mastered a lot of basic hardware knowledge.

### **Extracurricular achievements obtained at school**

#### **China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest**

From 2006 to 2008, I found a fairer platform to present my ability than the high school entrance exam without local or no-local bias. I attend CASTIC, which is one of the biggest national science competitions in China.

My topic is *The herbicidal and bacteriostatic effects of Solidago canadensis*. The background Solidago canadensis is an alien species in Shanghai; it has a great competitive advantage over native plants in Shanghai and China, causing society to spend a lot of money on the removal of it. But if we can find its commercial value, then we can recover part of the cost.

I started the personal research in my final year of junior high school in 2006, and I got help from my teacher from junior high school, who helped me find a professor at Shanghai University and lent me the Sterile laboratory. My teacher and I established multiple control groups and finally found that its extract would cause the roots of other plants to shrink and hinder the growth of mould colonies at a certain concentration.

It won the first prize in Shanghai in 2007 and won the third prize in China in 2008. The skills I learned here, such as problem-solving, perseverance, and the courage to try, stay with me.

#### **Travelling**

As a hobby, I travelled a lot during my high school and university vacations. I learned about different cultures and social situations from all over China deeply. I spend a lot of time in the most underdeveloped areas of China, such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Tibet.

Those experiences sharpened my attributes with an open mind and empathy. Also, in high school, that vivid story helped me become a passionate speaker; I believe my high school peers still remember my speech and how impressed they were.

#### **A campus newspaper reporter**

From 2011 to 2012, I was a reporter for the campus newspaper at my university. I followed up and reported the university's canteen safety and hygiene improvements. The difficulty lies in how to collect real information and successfully publish it under strict supervision.

I have made incredible friendships, and we are always in touch now.

#### **University debate contest**

I attended the newbie's debate in my first term of university as the first speaker. I consistently attended the university debate during my second term. In that term, my team won the third prize.

I was voted as the debate team leader of the Manufacturing College of my university and switched my position to conclusion speaker when I was a Sophomore. We defeated the teams of Journalism College, Spanish Language College, Computer Information College and Philosophy College. We lost the game with Law College and won second place.

During the debate contest, our team had moments of high morale but also experienced downturns under great pressure. Those stresses came from other top priorities, an unfavourable topic for us or losing a game. As a team leader, I encourage my team members in two ways: First, I show my own attitude, my hard work and my perseverance. Second, I believe we will activate our potential when we want to achieve self-target. I encourage them to find the various target for themself, not only to win the contest. Some want to show their gifts in speech, some like to practice their verbal skill, and some value our team's friendship.

### **Summary of my early education**

I have achieved substantial achievements during my education years, such as the control algorithm part of my tutor's project, and won awards from various contests. However, I value more the personal qualities that education has shaped for me. They helped me to overcome challenges during my career.
