## Present situation

### Study in Application Development

I started pursuing my post-degree at college in Canada in May 2023. The application development course expands my knowledge domain, especially in UI design and development.

The complexity of UI development comes from two aspects: one is user interaction, and another is computer science. The front-end engineer did a lot of work to reduce the complexity, which really impacted me, especially the declarative programming and using the compiler to improve the performance.

This journey satisfied my curiosity in many ways, not only in technical skills but also in different cultures and languages.

I'm in my last term now. In my first term and my second term, I got a GPA of 4.08 and 4.1, with a maximum of 4.2.

### Next to Learn

There are some new skills I want to learn:

1. proficient in Rust language. Since the Linux kernel Officially supported Rust in 2022, proficiency in it will be important. I've been learning about it for a while now and hope to start using it in personal projects later in 2024.
2. Grab VHDL or Verilog. Hardware description language will boost my ability in the embedded system domain.
3. Seeking the project manager measure. I think the project manager can be used not only in the team project but also in achieving personal goals.

I believe most of the obstacles in the world are just a door, not a filter. If we observe carefully, think carefully, keep trying, and follow the plan step by step, we can find a way to open the door.

## Career Development

During the 7 years of a tight career, my software experience spans multiple embedded projects, and I play multiple roles in some of them. My curiosity drives me to explore a wider range of areas.

All of the above helped me to sharpen my strengths as a software engineer:

1. Proficiently C programming skills.
2. Understand multiple Chip Architecture. Arm, MIPS, RISC-V.
3. Solidly embedded knowledge.
4. Strong problem-solving ability. I'm good at finding solutions to current problems from multiple fields.
5. Excellent communication and document skills, which are shown in this document.
6. Self-management, self-motivation, never giving up, and curiosity. This is my ultimate competitiveness.

My proudest success, for now, is designing and implementing the data path of an AI accessory card in my last company. It's simple and efficient.

In the next years, I hope that I can continually explore my interests in the software field as much as possible and become an expert in the embedded field within ten years.

## Future Perspective

### Open source

### Canonical and I

### Canonical and competitors

Based on the position I applied for, I think we can focus on discussing the competitors of  Ubuntu Core.
