## Present situation

### Study in Application Development

I started pursuing my post-degree at college in Canada in May 2023. The application development course expands my knowledge domain, especially in UI design and development.

The complexity of UI development comes from two aspects: one is user interaction, and another is computer science. The front-end engineer did a lot of work to reduce the complexity, which really impacted me, especially the declarative programming and using the compiler to improve the performance.

This journey satisfied my curiosity in many ways, not only in technical skills but also in different cultures and languages.

I'm in my last term now. In my first term and my second term, I got a GPA of 4.08 and 4.1, with a maximum of 4.2.

### Next to Learn

There are some new skills I want to learn:

1. Proficient in Rust language. Since the Linux kernel Officially supported Rust in 2022, proficiency in it will be necessary. I've been learning about it for a while now and plan to start using it in personal projects later in 2024.
2. Grab VHDL or Verilog. Hardware description language will boost my ability in the embedded system domain.
3. Seeking the project manager measure. I think the project manager can be used not only in the team project but also in achieving personal goals.

I believe most obstacles in the world are just a door, not a filter. If we observe, think, keep trying, and follow the plan step by step, we can find a way to open the door.

## Career Development

During the 7 years of a tight career, my software experience spans multiple embedded projects, and I play multiple roles in some of them. My curiosity drives me to explore a wider range of areas.

All of the above helped me to sharpen my strengths as a software engineer:

1. Proficiently C programming skills.
2. Understand multiple Chip Architecture. Arm, MIPS, RISC-V.
3. Solidly embedded knowledge.
4. Strong problem-solving ability. I'm good at finding solutions to current problems from multiple fields.
5. Excellent communication and document skills, which are shown in this document.
6. Self-management, self-motivation, never giving up, and curiosity. This is my ultimate competitiveness.

My proudest success, for now, is designing and implementing the data path of an AI accessory card in my last company. It's simple and efficient.

In the next years, I hope that I can continually explore my interests in the software field as much as possible and become an expert in the embedded field within ten years.

## Future Perspective

### Open source

I was involved in a task that followed up and pushed drivers of the BSP group upstream into the Android kernel branch at my second company.

I was involved in open-source software that could publish my course schedule for my course. I implemented the spider part in Python.

I developed a background process for `vim-autotag` and sent a pull request.

During my university, I submitted some issues for the Marlin project and wrote some Chinese blogs to introduce it to Chinese 3D printer enthusiasts.

### Canonical and I

I appreciate Canonical's contributions to open-source software.

Additionally, I think the Ubuntu Core has great significance in the embedded domain. Embedded development will always be considered a long research and development cycle and high investment. Because of the diversity of hardware devices, embedded engineers need a lot of hardware knowledge. All of these prevent the development of embedded ecology. If the Ubuntu Core can provide a platform that handles the details of the hardware and makes application development easier, it will greatly promote the development of the entire embedded field.

I hope I have the honour to join that group.

### Canonical and competitors

Based on the position I applied for, I think we can focus on discussing the Ubuntu Core. From my understanding, the goal of Ubuntu Core is to provide an application development environment. The low-level hardware detail will be handled by Canonical. This is different from some embedded system providers, such as FreeRTOS and VxWorks. Their purpose is to provide a framework to help customers handle the low-level hardware detail.

Based on the above understanding, I listed Ubuntu Core's competitors as follows:

1. Wind River Linux, Yocto Project and Linux distributions of each equipment manufacturer

   They are our fiercest direct competitors. They have advantages in customized equipment. The advantage of Ubuntu Core is a more convenient application development environment, especially the `Snap`. I suggest two options to win the competition.

   1. Broaden the range of hardware supported by Ubuntu Core.
   2. Respond proactively to the needs of our partners.

2. FreeRTOS, VxWorks, Zephyr and bare-metal firmware

   Ubuntu Core was limited by Linux, which can not run on some platforms that they can. But in other situations, our potential customers may select them because of concerns about the performance.

   1. Ubuntu Core can provide performance debugging tools that are more suitable for embedded systems.

3. The QNX system of BlackBerry

   BlackBerry consistently reinforces the advantage of the QNX system in the Automotive Embedded System domain. To win that race, Ubuntu Core should:

   1. Enhanced support for automotive sensors, such as radar distance sensors.

4. Android

   Android is worth learning in the field of application development environment. They have powerful development kits, Android Studio, and complete application markets.

   1. Ubuntu Core can launch an Easy-to-use development kit.

In summary, Ubuntu Core can be enhanced from two aspects: Working closely with partners to add support for different hardware and providing more kits for application development, such as performance debugging kits and UI development kits.
