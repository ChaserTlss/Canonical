# Draft

## Idea

It seems like Canonical requires me to write an autobiograph. Details about my career experience (8 years), my education (18 years), and my career development, which is my future. Since I'm only 32 years old, this has been almost my whole life. I have so many things to share, and my memories never lost any frame of my life.

**But is this really what they want?**

They want me to share details not because they are interested in me or want to be my friends but because they want me to show my qualifications to determine if I align with that position well.

**I think concise and convincing will be valuable.**
